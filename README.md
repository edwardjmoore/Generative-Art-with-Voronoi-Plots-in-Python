# What is this project?
This is my first attempt at generative art using python.
I used the concept developed by Geoffrey Bradway as a guide (https://www.generativehut.com/post/robots-and-generative-art-and-python-oh-my)

# Files:
### Manual
Runs through the concepts that will be used

### Interactive
For producing art outputs using an interactive slider to view iterations. The jupyter notebook needs to be run with interactive extension.
