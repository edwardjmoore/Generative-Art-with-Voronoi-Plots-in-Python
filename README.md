# What is this project?
This is my very first attempt at creating generative art using python.
I developed this project with inspiration from the original concept by Geoffrey Bradway (https://www.generativehut.com/post/robots-and-generative-art-and-python-oh-my)

## Files:
#### set_up
Details the concepts and steps that are taken to achieve the generative art.

#### interactive
This is the main jupyter notebook file that produces the voronoi art. It contains an interactive slider that can be used to iterate and experiment with different designs. The jupyter notebook needs to be run with the interactive extension.
